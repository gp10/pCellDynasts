# Clonal_Lineage_Inference
Computational methods used for model parameter inference and for evaluating the goodness-of-fit of simulated vs. experimental clone sizes.
### Dependencies
- **Analysis-modelParamFit-BasalCloneSizes.m** : main script used for assessing model goodness-of-fit on different data sets (the user can select an experimental clonal data set of interest and the code runs simulations of the SP or SC-CP model under specified parameter conditions, retrieving a log-Likelihood value and plotting fits on clone size distributions and average clone size over time).
- **Analysis-modelParamFit-Data-Giroux2017.m** : script used for evaluating the SP model fit on Giroux et al (2017) data set (both clone density and label distribution across different layer compartments are addressed).
- **Analysis-modelParamFit-InterscaleLabeling-SanchezDanes2016.m** : script used for evaluating the SP model fit on Sánchez-Danés et al (2016) interscale Krt14 labelling data (clone density as well as the inferred % of labelled cells are addressed).
- Datasets : contains the experimental lineage tracing data from the esophagus and different skin territories referred to in the manuscript.
- SelectModelParamVal.m : function used to call to specific model parameter sets.
- MonteCarloSimulator-SP-BasalCloneDynamics.m : function used to run time course simulations of basal-layer clone sizes under the SP model.
- MonteCarloSimulator-SP-BasalCloneDynamics-Fullgrabe2015.m : a modified version of the previous one to consider simulations starting from already preformed clones, pertinent for the analysis of data from Füllgrabe et al (2015).
- MonteCarloSimulator-SP-TotalCloneDynamics-Giroux2017.m : a modified version used to include suprabasal cell dynamics, pertinent for the analysis of data from Giroux et al (2017).
- MonteCarloSimulator-SCCP-BasalCloneDynamics.m : function used to run time course simulations of basal-layer clone sizes under the SC-CP model.
- MonteCarloSimulator-2xSC-TotalCloneDynamics.m : function used to run time course simulations of basal-layer clone sizes under the 2xSC model from Sada et al (2016).
- logLike-calc.m : computes the log-Likelihood match of simulated vs. experimental clone size distributions.
- size2freq.m : calculates the frequency histogram (distribution) of clone sizes from their individual sizes.
- size2freqbinned.m : calculates the frequency histogram (distribution) binned in categories increasing in size in powers of 2.
- sampling-Initial-Clone-Fullgrabe2015.m : picks random initial clone sizes and compositions in the analysis of Füllgrabe et al (2015) data.
- simulate-subsampled-avgCloneSize-SanchezDanes2016.m : performs subsampling from a large pool of clonal data and retrieves descriptive subsample clone size statistics for the analysis of Sánchez-Danés et al (2016) interscale Krt14 labelling data.
- simulate-subsampled-InducedCloneDens-SanchezDanes2016.m : performs subsampling simulating a variable labelling induction and retrieves descriptive subsample clone density statistics for the analysis of Sánchez-Danés et al (2016) interscale Krt14 labelling data.
- infer-TotalLabelledCells-trend.m : retrieves the inferred % of labelled cells and its level of uncertainty based on sample measurements of average clone size and clone density, pertinent for the analysis of Sánchez-Danés et al (2016) interscale Krt14 labelling data.
